ucb_openberkeley-7.x
============

Purpose
=======

General purpose module for Open Berkeley customizations (for OB beta4 sites)

Note: For OB sites on the latest platform, use the master branch.

Branches
========

The drupal.org git strategy is not to use the master branch. Click on
the github Branches tab to get to the 6.x and 7.x branches. The
READMEs on the branches are a lot more entertaining.
